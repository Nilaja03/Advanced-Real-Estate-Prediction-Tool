# Advanced Real Estate Prediction Tool
This project is a real estate price prediction tool built using Random Forest Regression and deployed as a web application using Streamlit. The model is trained on an extensive dataset with 287 features, processed with feature scaling, finding missing data, and outlier handling.

## Features

1. Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a fine-tuned Random Forest Regressor for accurate predictions.

2. Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes feature scaling, finding missing data, and outlier detection.

3. Web Application: Developed using Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface.

4. User Inputs: Users can input house features via the web app to get instant price predictions.

5. Scalability: Designed for easy deployment and scalability.

## How to run the app

Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser and enter house features.
2. Click "Predict Price" to get the estimated price.
